# SAIL Coding Challenge

Implementation of a match-making algorithm using secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques.

## Directory

1. *SecureAddition*: Secure addition using Secret Sharing. This application helps me to understand how MPC works and move toward to the next application.

2. *SecureBitMul*: Secure bit Multiplication (Match-making). No Oblivious Transfer. This program is problematic and doesn't serve its purpose.
